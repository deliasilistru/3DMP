The Final Project file includes the main pieces for the Flyng Sea Turtle Automata , a photo and a video of the model and the canvases (front view and side view) of the model.

I chose to build the flying sea turtle because i love animals and when i saw this mechanism i was fascinated.

Everything is powerd by the movment of a crank, conected to a gear. Once that gear is moving, another two gears will rotate, each one having a rod atached, who will rotate as well, making the turtle move her wings and body up and down.  To make this motion I used mainly revolute joint on the crank, gears and rods, but also slider joints on the body of the turtle, and on the rod holders, to create a back and front movement. To see the motion, i rotate the crank.

In this repo i have .f3d, .png and .stl files, and also an mp4 file. To design and render the mechanism i used Autodesk Fusion 360.
