# 3DMP

In this repo you can find all my homeworks and materials for the 3D Modeling and Printing course, held at Universty of Bucharest.

The Final Project includes the main pieces for the Flyng Sea Turtle Automata (not including the turtle, for now) and the canvases (front view and side view) of the model.
